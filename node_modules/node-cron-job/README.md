This is a cron job scheduler for Node.

It can fork a new process for each job, resulting in zero impact on application performance.

Otherwise, the inherently single-threaded node server may be blocked
until an I/O intensive cron job finishes.

This module has been tested with Node v4 and v5 with ES6 at least.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install node-cron-job
```



## Setup

The jobs have to be declared in a separate module such as:
```js
// jobs.js

exports.first_job = {
    
    after: {                // Configuring this job to run after this period.
        seconds: 2,
        minutes:2,
        hours: 1,
        days: 3
    },
    job: function () {
        console.log("first_job");
    },
    spawn: true             
}

exports.second_job = {
    
    on: "*/2 * * * * *",    // Cron tab instruction.
    job: function () {
        console.log("second_job");
    },
    spawn: false            // If false, the job will not run in a separate process.
}
```

Next, the module may be used any where within your code to indicate the absolute path to the 
jobs file and explicit instructions to start those jobs. Example:

```js
// main.js

var cronjob = require('node-cron-job');


cronjob.setJobsPath(__dirname + '/jobs.js');  // Absolute path to the jobs module.

cronjob.startJob('first_job');

cronjob.startJob('second_job');
```


## API

Each job exported by the jobs module can have the following objects:

* `on`: The cron tab instruction string that defines the schedule. Please see [crontab.org](http://crontab.org/).

[cron-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron-parser) is used to parse these.

* `after`: A easier-to-use but less expressive way to schedule a job. It defines
the time after which the job is supposed to run, periodically. This will take priority over `on`. 
Example:

```txt
after: {
    hours: 2,
    days: 10
},
```

* `job`: The job closure/function that is to be scheduled.

* `spawn`: A boolean value telling the module to run this job in a separate forked process or in the same
thread as your application. This should be set according to scalibility and peformance needs.
The default value is true.


The module includes these methods:

* `setJobsPath(abs_path)`: Sets the absolute path to the jobs module.

* `startJob(job_name)`: Starts the given job.

* `startAllJobs()`: Starts all jobs defined in the jobs module.


## Future releases

Currently there is a problem with jobs that have a number of weeks in between them.

It'll be fixed soon.
